# ipl-prediction-1st-hypothesis
My Hypothesis is that the winning team prediction depends on the players batting &amp; bowling profile.

Dataset :https://www.kaggle.com/saiharsha1234/ipl-prediction-1st-hypothesis . Tools used : Python Libraries used : pandas, numpy

I created player profile using deliveries information of season 2008 upto season 2016 and tried to validate my hypothesis on season 2017 matches.

End Result : My hypothesis doesnt hold true when looked for 5 matches. So our hypothesis that the winning team prediction depends on player profile cannot be used to predict 2020 winners.
